            <h5> 
Cloudy morning. Perfect for my lack of sleep last night, I just curled up in my bed and hoped to drift off at some point, which didn’t happen. I sure could go without a bright sun in my eyes first thing this morning. As I walked myself to school I felt like I was forgetting something; however, my brain was too clouded by a lack of sleep to figure out just what I was forgetting. I’m sure it’d come back to bite me later anyways, I told myself as I continued my morning walk. The high school lay on a hill atop a long main street lined with shops and people walking to and fro. It was a Monday, the city was awake and ready to get their daily routines done for the day so they could spend the evening relaxing. 
<br>
<br>
I eventually made it to the front gates, with four taller buildings laid out to separate the grades from each other while keeping them in close proximity for socialization. There were several smaller buildings littering the grounds too, mostly for club or band use. I was here early for one of those clubs, the weight-lifting club. Surprisingly, only three members were on the roster… Three members.
<br>
<br>
Ah, that’s what I had forgotten this morning. Part of my routine was to pick up one of our members from her home before I came to school. It was a bit late to walk all the way back for her, so I suppose it wouldn’t hurt for her to be late. That assumes she comes at all, she usually sleeps for 12-14 hours straight without someone to wake her up and will readily roll back into bed if time permits. Time will tell, so I laughed a little to myself thinking of her panicking when she realizes the time upon waking up. Wait. Am I allowed to laugh at that? “Probably not, no.” I silently say to myself upon taking the time to think about it being all my fault she’s late. “Damn, maybe she should get up on her own every once in a while.” My bad, I’ll make sure to remember the other 4 days of the week. 
<br>
<br>
Member Number 3 was standing in front of the club building looking at me weirdly as I arrived. “Hello, Hashaky. I noticed you don’t have that cat trailing you today.” 
<br>
<br>
Member Number 3 was Ezial Wordsworth, he was weird. Constantly obsessed with time and punctuality. He liked to talk about the possibilities of returning to the past, but I passed it off as nostalgia usually. Time machines aren’t real, the world of science fiction is separate from reality. Granted, I owed him a lot. Without him, this club would not have been reality. 
<br>
<br>
“Yeah, I happened to forget this morning. I’m sure she’ll give me hell for it later.” I smirked a little bit, but felt bad all the same. My fault, my fault. I tell myself I can’t laugh at the misfortune I caused. 
<br>
<br>
“I’ll mark her absent then, I suppose. You both need to learn some punctuality.” 
<br>
<br>
He was waving his hands around like he was reprimanding me. I tried, sir. I tried… It's only 5 minutes after anyways. “Since when were you keeping attendance!? You’re no teacher! A fraud! A fraud!” I laughed at myself a little and began to usher him inside.
<br>
<br>
“I’ve always been keeping it. Need to set times down all the time after all, you’re not being graded, sir. No worries except for me judging you two.” Why does he always sound so casual? He says it without even reeling back, it hurts a bit to think I can’t even get a dig at this guy. He continued, “Maybe we can go back to the past and you can fix your attendance one day.”
<br>
<br>
Ah. I see. “The first thing I’d do if time machines were real would not be to fix my attendance. Did you get marked tardy once and vow to never do it again or something? I can’t even see that being near my top 10 things to do in a science fiction novel.” Maybe this’ll get at him. Maybe, just maybe. 
<br>
<br>
“No. Time machines are real too, I just don’t have access to one. I wouldn’t use it to fix small things like that either though. I was just joking.” He’s STILL so calm.
<br>
<br>
“You-” I started to retort, but was cut off by a voice calling out to us from the building to our side. 
<br>
<br>
“Ezial! Hashaky! How’s it going?!” Uh-oh. Maeve, the captain of the swordsmanship club was here early as well. The club shared a building with us, just separated by a door in our weights room. Usually we could both hear each other when our clubs had activities at the same time, so we tended to take different parts of the day to do so. 
<br>
<br>
“Hello, Miss-” Ezial started, but Maeve continued before he even had the chance to get out her name. He immediately shut his mouth and had a bewildered look on his face. I stifled a chuckle.
<br>
<br>
“For this next week our club will be meeting in the morning as well. I know you don’t like changing your times, Time Traveler, so I’m just letting you know. Let’s get along together, please.” She held out her hand to me and I reluctantly shook it. The week would be louder than usual. I’m still fighting a headache born from my lack of sleep so it ticked me off just a bit, but I kept quiet.
<br>
<br>
“You know I really wouldn’t have any objections if you didn’t even let us know. We both share the space.” I said as I scratched my head a bit, disturbing my carefully done headband on accident and knocking some hair into my face. Damnit.
<br>
<br>
“Well.” She paused. “Yes.” She’s not the best talker ever and took a minute to think before blurting out really loudly, “YEAH, but it's common courtesy, isn’t it?! I could have just interrupted your morning instead?!” She already is, but whatever, really. “Anyways. Where’s your sister, Hashaky? Ain’t she usually with you all the time?” 
<br>
<br>
“I forgot to wake her up this morning. She’ll be upset with me later.” Wait a second. “Hold on, she’s not my sister.” Who else thought she was? Why?
<br>
<br>
“Could’ve had me fooled then. You call her mom ‘Mom’, don’tcha?” Get out of my business, get out of my business, get out of my business.
<br>
<br>
“Yeah.” I can’t fire back at that. Truth be told, though, things would be a bit easier if she was my sister. Maybe Mom will wake her up. “Anyways, where’s the other two stooges? They not with you for club activities this morning?” 
<br>
<br>
“Ehhh, they’ll be here. First day having to wake up early for them after all. I wouldn’t worry too much about it.” Maeve smiled and laughed a little and made a couple steps for the door, indicating us all to turn that way and start going inside.
<br>
<br>
While we were doing so, Ezial finally chimed in from the side. “Not very punctual it seems. We only have so much time in the mornings, the least they could do is show up on time.” Why he was worried about another club’s punctuality? Beats me, honestly. He meant well, I’m sure.
<br>
<br>
“Shut it, Doctor Who. Not everyone can be as freakishly on time as you. I keep the attendance for my club anyways.” Huffy and puffy, she was. It was great to finally put the brakes on the conversation though and get around to club activities, so I didn’t continue it and neither did Ezial. 
<br>
<br>
Our weight room was pretty humble, it was barely funded by the school and actually included a bunch of stuff that Ezial had convinced his family to buy for us to use. It wasn’t much, but it had a mirror, some free weights, a couple ropes, and a bench. It was more than we really needed for a couple high-schoolers making it an extracurricular activity to work out.
<br>
<br>
Today was chest and arms day. Eventually the other two stooges for the swordsmanship club showed up and they began to work on their activities together without a word to the two of us over here. I pushed Ezial pretty hard as revenge for earlier, but he seemed to enjoy the extra challenge. He was a rather nerdy dude usually, but also someone who enjoyed looking out for himself and his health when he entered this room. Plus, he was the only one I could get to sign-on to our club documents and he became a pretty close friend of mine during our daily mornings. I don’t know him too closely, but that was okay. He pushed me in the same way I pushed him and was a perfect gym partner. Our other member barely even did workouts, she was just here most of the time, sleeping. Another reason to be happy to have Ezial around.
<br>
<br>
“Pay attention, Hashaky. You’re zoning out.” Ezial said as I was sitting in the middle of a bench press. “Doing so many without keeping count is bad for your muscles.” He was right, I’ll feel the extra work tomorrow. I set the bar back on its hook and sat up, stretching my arms and chest out in a way that felt correct. I could hear the act of swords hitting together and people being knocked around from the other room.
<br>
<br>
With that we were done with the weight-room. We’d just need to move over to the gym the swordsmanship club was active in for the track.
<br>
<br>
That’s what would have happened. Instead, I heard a sound from the entrance and was immediately pounced upon by a bundle of white.
