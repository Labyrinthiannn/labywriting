                <h2> Hello there. Here's me and here's what I'm working on! </h2>
                <br>
                <p> Welcome to the website I'll be using to host my writing works as I release them. This place is subject to change in time as I get better with web design and other creative ventures. For now, it's pretty basic. You likely know me by <span style="color: #FF007F;">Fenn Unsu, Labyrinth, or Hunter</span>. I hope to keep your attention with my writing. <span style="color: #FFCC33;">I am very open to constructive criticism</span> on my works as well, if you have any make sure to give me a reach out via the contact section at the bottom of this page.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                <p> Currently I am working on <span style="color: #50BFE6;">'To these I welcome along, Sun, Moon, and Star.' (Referred to as SMS VN or SMS:A internally. A fanwork of 'Sun, Moon, and Star. To these I bid adieu.' by Cyn_Clical.)</span> as well as planning for two other writing projects. One of which is untitled and unreferable, whilst the other is a side project to accompany a very early game development project some will know as <span style="color: #50BFE6;">'Objects Floating in the Wind' (OFitW).</span></p> 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <p>I have a number of internal project ideas that are not fully expanded on, though I hope to get to a point where I am comfortable sharing these as well. Thank you for your time, and I hope the journey to be worth it. </p>

                <p>This was a short story created in a week or so for one of Epic Department's writing contests. This story won me the writing contest and awarded me some rather wonderful constructive criticism. I want to do more with the characters in the work, but for now here they are in a really short romance story about two adults at work.</p>

                <h4> Current Status: <i>Ongoing</i> </h4>

                <p> This is a fanwork for Cyn_Clical's Roblox game <a class="smsaanchor" href="https://www.roblox.com/games/7554879061/sun-moon-and-star-to-these-i-bid-adieu">Sun, Moon, and Star. To These I Bid Adieu.</a> It follows my own personal fancanon and uses characters outside of where they should be. This also features several different characters unique to the fanwork itself and aims to create a story told as if I were the one who wrote the lore of the game, while appealing to fans of several different characters. This is my main currently ongoing project.

                <p>I'll reveal more about this work in time when I begin to write it. My main inspirations while drafting this have been a mixture of Moby Dick, 2000s MMOs like Ragnarok Online, and the desire to be on the open sea with somebody else. This will likely be my next written project, but it is in the drafting phase for the overarching story.</p>

                <p>This was intended to be written a year ago when I first had the idea to begin creating Objects Floating in the Wind for the Dream Diary Game Jam on itch.io. My team and I (Coalescence of Hampter) never got around to doing so, so I never went through with creating it. Both are still on my mind and my agenda. This would be the first step taken into creating the lifelong story path I have been drafting since Middle School.</p>
