DREAM DIARY ENTRY 7/16/2012
<br>
<br>
When I went to sleep last night, it was a noticeably different feeling than any previous dream I’ve ever had in my 25 years on this earth. 
<br>
<br>
I was lucid for the first time in my life. I had full control of my voice, my emotions, my movement, everything. My appearance was exactly how I viewed myself as well.
<br>
<br>
Instead of this being a good feeling, it carried towards me a sense of foreboding. It was like I wasn’t dreaming at all. Everything around me had felt real and carried alongside it the air of a place that existed right where I was. It was like a coin had flipped over in the world and I was the only person on the underside. 
<br>
<br>
Well, whatever. Into the dream. Here’s what happened, it still sticks in my memory clearer than any other dream I’ve had.
<br>
<br>
- - -
<br>
<br>
I began to test out my body immediately, experimenting every which way I could use it in a similar fashion to the waking world I knew so well. “Hah…”, I sighed, “What a unique experience. I suppose I can learn from this.” The environment was strange, a painted, twisting, wonderful world that expanded limitlessly before me. The colors of the buildings and city I found myself in were painted on, like somebody had randomly selected colors for each different environment and object.
<br>
<br>
I hoisted my backpack up along my back, full of an assortment of a ton of random items. I had no idea what it was for, but it was graciously provided to me and equally accepted by myself. Following along an idealistic version of my own personal self, it felt like I was really an explorer or scientist ready to discover more about the human mind and what dreams were. Maybe the unsettling tiredness I felt was part of that image I had for myself. 
<br>
<br>
Looking forward, in the middle of the city I found myself in, a large looming tower planted itself in the very middle of everything. The top was not visible and even now I have a feeling there was no top to this tower. I marked my destination and began to walk, taking in the unique environments around me as I walked.
<br>
<br>
Amidst the winding world, there were sections that felt like they belonged to somewhere else. I saw a monument with a bright red square in the middle, surrounded by a cover of ice. There was no making my way through the ice without making a ton of noise, and it seemed to be intentionally sectioned off from everything around me. I took my leave with just a mental note, and happened to do the same with several other differently colored monuments spread through alleyways pointing away from the central focus of the tower. 
<br>
<br>
After what felt like hours of exploration, I had made no progress in approaching the thing. It got further and further away the closer I stepped. It was a point of research that was avoiding me and it just made me want to reach it all the more.
<br>
<br>
Just then, when I thought that. 
<br>
<br>
<i>Crack. Pound. Crunch.</i>
<br>
<br>
Something big was here and the sounds made my body shake with fright. What could be here in this land with nobody else? My thoughts raced.
<br>
<br>
“I need to get away. I need to get away.” Forefront of my mind. Pounding against my skull over and over. “I need to run. The tower is my only solace. I need to run.”
<br>
<br>
I caught a glimpse of the sound’s origin. A creature of a form I can’t even place. Limbs that extended out in inhuman proportions, not even similar to those of a wild beast. Yet it was growling and emanating an aura of hatred unlike anything I have ever experienced. Exciting, but I would die here if I didn’t run. Even in a dream, I feared my own mortality, this experience felt real. 
<br>
<br>
I ran towards the tower, thinking to myself. <i>“I wish to go faster, I wish to move beyond my own capabilities. If I don’t, that creature will be upon me.”</i> Before I knew it, my backpack was opening on my back. Out of it came a bike. Sleek with red paint, it planted itself underneath me and I was on it within seconds.
<br>
<br>
Right on time too, as the entity behind me cracked the ground that I was just walking on and roared a roar that shook me. Whatever it was, it was hunting me for sure. 
<br>
<br>
The feelings of unease, the feelings of hatred, the feelings of excitement, the feelings of fear. It turned my pedaling into that of an experienced cyclist, bringing the tower’s entrance before me in just a few minutes.
<br>
<br>
Before even being able to think about my entry, a human flew past me. White hair and a black suit. 
<br>
<br>
He called out, “You shouldn’t be here. Begone.” 
<br>
<br>
Right away, I woke up. My last sight was the flash of a sword coming in contact with the monster that had chased me fervently. 
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
I hope to be back there again. The experience I had certainly was one I would like to pursue.
